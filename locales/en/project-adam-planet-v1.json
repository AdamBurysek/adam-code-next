  "project-desc": "In 2022, I decided to refresh my programming skills. I started with Python and wrote several small programs. One day, a friend showed me how to connect these programs to the frontend, which inspired me to learn frontend development as well. In the past, I had created a few websites using Flash, which is now an outdated technology. I found a tutorial on web development and learned the basics of HTML and CSS within two weeks. I picked it up fairly quickly. Then, I decided to develop my first website. Since I enjoyed it, I dedicated a week of continuous work to it, and the result was this website."
