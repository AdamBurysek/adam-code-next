  "header-info": "An application demonstrating changes in land with rising sea levels.",
  "project-desc": "This simple application complements a physical exhibit and changes images according to the slider position, illustrating changes in landmass with sea level changes. I have preserved the original images from the exhibit, only modifying the design.",
  "project-desc-two": "For this application, I also wrote a Python program to convert the original PNG images to WebP format. Since there were approximately 180 images, this saved a lot of disk space and allowed the application to run faster.",
  "project-desc-three": "The application is designed for a resolution of 1920x1080 and is not responsive. The web version may have a few issues, such as incorrect font loading. In the future, I plan to add installation files in case anyone wants to install and try it."
