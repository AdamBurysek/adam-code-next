  "project-desc-two": "I created the first version using the Mantine library, which I wanted to try out. I added a simple CMS system to this website, allowing me to add new projects without modifying the code. I used my favorite MongoDB as the database and chose Cloudinary for image storage. The advantage of Cloudinary is its automatic image cropping and conversion to webp format. I really liked Mantine, but I think there are better alternatives on the market.",
  "project-desc-three": "In the second version, I moved away from Mantine. On the homepage, I created a parallax animation using the Framer Motion library. In an era of fast websites, I wanted to experiment with implementing a loading process. To ensure the loading wasn't too short, I used a special font that needs to be downloaded along with the images before accessing the site. I created the loading animation purely with CSS to ensure it loads quickly. I retained the project cards from the first version, so MongoDB and Cloudinary remained in use."
