  "project-desc": "I enjoy experimenting with new technologies on my web projects. This time, I focused on Next.js and Three.js. This was about my fourth small project using Next.js, which I have come to really like. There are many reasons for this: it offers great support for server-side rendering, which significantly improves performance and SEO, allows for easy integration with APIs, and provides efficient routing management. Additionally, its flexibility and support for modern React features, such as static generation and image optimization, allow me to quickly create efficient and powerful applications.",
  "project-desc-two": "Another technology I wanted to try was the Three.js library. It allows for the rendering of 3D objects on web pages using the WebGL API."
