  "project-desc": "One day, I had the idea to create a trading bot. The project intrigued me so much that within a single day, I wrote a program that connected my Python application to an exchange. By the second day, the program could open and close short and long positions, either with a profit or a loss. Within a week, I had programmed a simple strategy and a virtual wallet that accounted for exchange fees. Naturally, I didn't want to connect the bot to real money right from the start and risk losing it.",
  "project-desc-two": "The next part of the project proved to be very challenging â€“ programming a profitable scalping strategy. Scalping is quite a complex discipline in trading, especially due to the high fees associated with short-term trades. Even though I managed to reduce the fees to about a quarter of the normal rate, it remains a problem, and the profit from most of my strategies just covers the fees. Therefore, the bot is still operating in test mode.",
  "project-desc-three": "Nevertheless, it is a very interesting project that I will be happy to return to in my spare time."
