  "project-desc": "After mastering the basics of HTML and CSS, I started studying JavaScript. I wrote approximately 30 small programs focused on various tasks such as counting, filtering, scrolling, working with time, audio, and video. I also implemented basic frontend functions like a navbar, modal, carousel, accordion, and more. Out of all the projects, I found this one to be the most interesting and complex, so I decided to share it. Additionally, it is my first application that involves data storage using local storage.",
