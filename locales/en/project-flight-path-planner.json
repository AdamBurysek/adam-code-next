  "project-desc": "This simple application allows you to plan a route on the map. The application displays the distance, azimuth, and if the route has multiple points, the angle you need to turn. After plotting the route, you can finish it with a double-click, and a table with the individual waypoints will appear. These waypoints can then be edited with the mouse in edit mode or deleted using the table.",
